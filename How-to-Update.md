This will be a rollng release - updated every Wednesday and Friday (or as time permits). To keep up-to-date with the latest changes, simply run the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/jjhiza/ADI-Ebook.git

*** and to stay updated ***

git pull 

I'm creating this in order to streamline and aid my own study, and I hope that the rest of you will find it useful as well.
